This map has:
* It is just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with Jquery). 
* 257 countries each with id, name, latitude, longitude, capital name, geo-id, and extra information if used to know the praying times of the capital. 
* SVG Map, I used the one offered freely at https://mapsvg.com/. 
* A div box added as a tooltip that you can edit freely to be anything, as it is a div, not an HTML tooltip. 
* Map Zooming property using the svg-pan-zoom library with custom buttons that you can edit. 
* A minimalist design, so you can use it directly in your environment.
